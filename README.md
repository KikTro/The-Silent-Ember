About the Game

The Silent Ember is a text-driven survival experience where you must keep your fire alive, manage hunger and health, gather resources, and uncover fragments of a hidden story. You begin in a ruined station with a fading fire and no memory of what happened.

Survive the cold, explore the forest, maintain your fire, send drones for supplies, and slowly recover pieces of your past.

Features

The fire burns down over time.

Stoke it using wood.
